<small>A clean implementation means that there is no chain of provenance by which the "clean" code could be considered a derivative work. When one intends to be careful, the clean implementation is written by someone who has never seen the IP-encumbered implementation. No amount of refactoring tainted code breaks that provenance chain, and given the proximity to the events in this thread, even if you were to start over with a blank file, there would be a reasonable claim that your new implementation is still tainted. Maybe you can find a colleague or student and ask them to implement the [Cash-Karp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods#Cash-Karp) method in Fortran, or use an existing library....</small>
