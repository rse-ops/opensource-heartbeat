<small>Thank you @chunyu79 for the update, and congratulations on finding a solution! I was able to run your test and reproduce the issue, but did not have time yet to investigate deeply. This was labeled as an AMR issue, but it seems more closely related to contact problems with constraints to couple boundaries of different domains. There has been recent work on this topic in PR 4996, and @psocratis may have some advice....</small>
