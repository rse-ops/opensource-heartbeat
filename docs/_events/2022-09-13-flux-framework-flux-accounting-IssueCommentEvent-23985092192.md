<small>> However, I think what is perhaps missing from the `mf_priority.so` plugin is that the plugin needs to search for jobs using the DNE bank entry after the bank entries are externally updated, and properly account for those jobs. If there are more active jobs than the newly configured bank allows, then those jobs should perhaps have an exception raised on them. Meanwhile, the jobs should have their `mf_priority:bank_info` pointer updated to the correct bank....</small>
