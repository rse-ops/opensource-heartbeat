<small>Haha, we should pin versions in `requirements.txt`. Having spent more time using Cargo (Rust), I'm increasingly convinced it was a bad idea for Python to encourage people to leave dependencies unversioned. (Lack of static analysis/care for strict semver also makes this harder in the Python world, but that's another matter.)...</small>
