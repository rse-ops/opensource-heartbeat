<small>An additional swizzle here is dealing with where the annotation image can be found in a parallel engine. In many cases, parallel compute nodes cannot see the same file system space login nodes do. So, the image file needs to get copied (or shipped as internal data) (maybe by the vcl or mdserver) to a place that the parallel engine can find it....</small>
