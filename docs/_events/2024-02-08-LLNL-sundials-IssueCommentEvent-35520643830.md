<small>@bangerth This issue has been addressed in our [v7.0.0 release candidate](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases/tag/v7.0.0-rc.1). If you or someone on the deal.ii team are able to test the release candidate (actually, it may be better to point to the develop branch which is the release candidate plus a few more fixes) in deal.ii, especially the new way we handle the `MPI_Comm`, it would be greatly appreciated.  We are planning to release a finalized v7.0.0 in a few weeks and any feedback is welcome....</small>
