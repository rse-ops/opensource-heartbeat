<small>Thanks. This has been tested a fair amount using the GPU backends, but I suspect some of this indexing has fallen through the cracks on CPU backends (where most of us use more MPI processes, and thus have much smaller subdomains). Let's see how much the clang-tidy check can identify these....</small>
