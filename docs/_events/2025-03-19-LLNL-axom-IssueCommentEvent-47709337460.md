<small>I made an MPI version of mir_concentric_circles and ran with 1,4,16 MPI ranks. Each MPI rank makes the same mesh. The 4 MPI rank cases run a little slower than the 1 rank case. The 16 rank case is slower still as there are 4 MPI ranks sharing each GPU. For some of the 16 rank cases, it OOMed at 64M zones....</small>
