<p>Add ability to get driver library version info</p><small>It would be nice, without having to include the HDF5 library in the client, for a client of Silo to get library version information from the underlying driver library. Probably the only reasonable thing to do is return it as a string of some kind. Different driver libraries can use very different versioning schemes and probably a string representation is the only approach that be portable....</small><a href='https://github.com/llnl/Silo/issues/514' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
