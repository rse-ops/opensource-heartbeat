<small>@grondo if you don't mind could you advise on if I have the right approach with including `-ljansson` as a library in `src/Makefile.am`? I noticed I had to include it here in order for the unit tests in `src/plugins/test/` to run. Just want to make sure this is okay, or if maybe there is a better way to handle this....</small>
