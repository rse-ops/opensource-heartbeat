<small>Hi @JacobLotz, thanks for raising this issue. Setting boundary attributes on a sample mesh is tricky, because the domain is smaller for the sample mesh than the original mesh. This is a known issue which has not been resolved, because there is no general way to set boundary attributes that will work for all cases. In other words, boundary attributes may need to be defined in a way dependent on the application. ...</small>
