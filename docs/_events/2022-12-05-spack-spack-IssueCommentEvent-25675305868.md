<small>I don't see any more problems with this, but now that core bootstrap is split out it looks like it should be a great deal easier to solve the bootstrap locking problem.  In fact I think you have solved it for everything but the core set because of the way the environment install works.  Would you be willing to take a stab at adding locking to the bootstrap.core end, perhaps shortly after this merges?...</small>
