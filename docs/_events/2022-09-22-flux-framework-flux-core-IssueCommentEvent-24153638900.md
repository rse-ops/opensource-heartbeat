<small>Could we just store the raw jobspec and R (these are JSON) for each job along with all of the events and have Kafka or some other data processing extract the necessary data from these objects? It would seem that limiting the stored data to what is just available in `job-list` for instance would possibly prevent other interesting queries (the base job environment is in jobspec for instance). ...</small>
