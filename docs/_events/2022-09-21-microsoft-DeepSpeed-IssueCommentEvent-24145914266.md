<small>This PR was written before the checkpoint bloat optimization was added.  I see that the layer checkpoint files are much smaller after rebasing to pick up the bloat fix.  That likely reduces absolute performance benefit from the graphs I show above, since the baseline cost should drop significantly.  I'd have to queue up a new set of runs....</small>
