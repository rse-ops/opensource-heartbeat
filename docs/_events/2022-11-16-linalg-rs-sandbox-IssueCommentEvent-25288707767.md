<small>Okay, this is like [ContinuumArrays.jl](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/ContinuumArrays.jl) and the way I have students construct the Legendre polynomials in my class (without that package). But if a `Vector` can be functions, why does it need an `Item`? They can't be "indexed", but algorithms like Gram-Schmidt work fine....</small>
