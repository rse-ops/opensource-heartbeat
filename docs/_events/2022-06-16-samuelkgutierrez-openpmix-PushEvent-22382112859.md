<small>gds/shmem: Support multiple local clients.

Tested on a single node, multiple clients now appear to share static
job-level information via shared-memory. We still have plenty of work
ahead, but at least it doesn't crash now. We now cache a pointer to a
full-featured gds module and pass certain operations to it.
