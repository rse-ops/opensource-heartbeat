<small>> Do we have a test for the case when save_to_disk is true? I may be missing something, but is the behavior different in the 2 cases now? If !save_to_disk, we auto checkpoint after every nonlinear solve, but I'm not seeing if that is still happening if save_to_disk==true? I may just be reading to quickly. Previously, this required a call to 'outputStateToDisk()'?...</small>
