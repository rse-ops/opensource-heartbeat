<small>I've had in mind to make a simple interface for creating a NCCL communicator from an MPI communicator, similar to [these examples](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/examples.html#example-2-one-device-per-process-or-thread). I think that would belong in cudarc under a feature flag (that would create an optional dependency on [rsmpi](https://github.com/rsmpi/rsmpi/))....</small>
