<small>@mhyatt000, what version of spack are you using? The dependency is listed, and has the correct version.  Is it not pulled in as one of the dependencies of your sched build? Here's the relevant [part of the package](https://github.com/spack/spack-packages/blob/develop/repos/spack_repo/builtin/packages/flux_sched/package.py#L74)....</small>
