<small>I'm a fan of MyST and would like to see high-quality HTML output. One issue will be that it's not uncommon for current authors to inline some LaTeX bits and that would need to be forbidden if we're publishing the same source also as HTML. There are some examples in the [sample paper](https://joss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submitting.html#example-paper-and-bibliography), but that list is far from exhaustive. In general, we would need to somehow verify both versions, and that sounds error-prone. ...</small>
