<small>@JacobLotz thank you for the explanation. Since I am not familiar with periodic meshes, I was hoping to get an example that works with this bug fix, to help me understand at least what this PR does. If you are still trying to get a basic example working, and the periodic mesh does not even load, then it sounds like this PR possibly fixes one issue without enabling a complete run of some example. If that is the case, would it make sense to wait and merge this bug fix when the other changes have been made to enable at least one example? On the one hand, I understand that there may be a lot of work left, and I don't want to complicate this small PR, but on the other hand, it seems better to have a more complete PR that fixes an actual example or test. Does this make sense, or am I misunderstanding something?...</small>
