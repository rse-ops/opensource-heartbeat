<small>I'm reasonably familiar with the algorithms, but don't have sufficient bandwidth at the moment. My research group mostly works on C/etc libraries for scientific computing, but we've been doing some porting to Rust and graph partitioning is one of the key libraries to hit critical mass such that Rust becomes viable for production use. The "easy" thing will be to bind METIS or SCOTCH and move on, but a native partitioner would help with distribution and enabling research. My question is mostly for longer term planning and what ideas to seed with students: is a partitioner something that you'd like to see developed in this package, versus in a separate package....</small>
