<small>Maybe there's a way to use the [tmate](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate) action to get interactive access to the container, thereby getting more information about why `docker manifest` is failing. It would work a lot better in a PR though.. maybe as a test you could create a PR that enables the arm64 build  along with a test action that attempts `docker manifest` after all the bookworm builds are done? If that reproduces the problem then this could be debugged in a PR......</small>
