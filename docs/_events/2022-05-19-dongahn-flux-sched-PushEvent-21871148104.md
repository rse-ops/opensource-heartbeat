<small>testsuite: test the graphml output can be generated

Problem: As we have been adding more into graph vertices (e.g.,
properties), we need to make sure some of the debugging features such
as resource graph output don't regress.

Add "-o" and "-g graphml" to a resource-query test case to generate
a graph when the command exits.</small>
