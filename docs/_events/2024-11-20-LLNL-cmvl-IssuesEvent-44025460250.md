<p>repo: ok to add Flux job logging script here?</p><small>Is this repo a good spot for me to add my custom scripts for generating the Flux `.ndjson` files? Let me know. Perhaps I can create a `flux` folder where I can stash the Python scripts for querying inactive jobs and generating the logs....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/cmvl/issues/2' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
