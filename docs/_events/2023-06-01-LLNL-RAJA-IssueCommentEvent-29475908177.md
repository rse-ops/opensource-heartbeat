<small>> Folks, this should be good to merge after checks pass. I'll leave the docs as is and note loop policy deprecation in the release notes for the upcoming release. @artv3 @MrBurmark is it easiest to merge this PR first since it covers many places in the code before merging your PRs? I think any conflicts, or changes needed in your PR changes will be simple type name replacements....</small>
