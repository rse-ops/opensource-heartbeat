<small>Don't worry about occasional failures in the `3.X optimize` checks. You are did not do anything wrong. Occasionally the number of BO probes is insufficient to converge to a good value or the sampler produces a particularly yucky surface. I am using generate tolerances and several iterations, but sometimes there is still a failure. This is a classic problem associated with testing stochastic code....</small>
