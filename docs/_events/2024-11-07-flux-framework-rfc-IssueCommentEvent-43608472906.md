<small>BTW, I just recalled that when we discussed this proposal of a minimum duration one possible solution was to still use the preemptible flag, but to have the job-manager post the flag to the eventlog as soon as minimum runtime expired. We should explore if that makes sense, or if we leave it up to the scheduler to look for any minimum runtime and implement preemption internally without need of any kind of flags....</small>
