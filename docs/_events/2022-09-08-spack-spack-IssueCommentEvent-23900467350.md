<small>Dang, yes, I see that.  It needs to add the appropriate set command I suppose, very strange gitlab didn't catch that.  It should be as simple as either making a second copy of the function or adding an option and using `cmake_cache_path` with the variable name and computed path in the existing one....</small>
