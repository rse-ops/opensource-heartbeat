<small>How much difference are you observing? Inlining doesn't enable further optimizations (like vectorization) so it should only be a few nanoseconds, but communication latency is generally in the microsecond range. I'm skeptical that measurements observing any larger differences are reproducible in microbenchmarks let alone a real application....</small>
