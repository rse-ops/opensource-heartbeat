<small>Ok, I am obviously misunderstanding things here. I thought the back-end went on to process all the markdown in a file including the markdown representing these refs. The HTML lines (beginning and ending tags) pass through unchanged so the final result is the html rendered by the backend bracketed by the styling tags `wikize_refs.py` inserted for the `divs` it creates....</small>
