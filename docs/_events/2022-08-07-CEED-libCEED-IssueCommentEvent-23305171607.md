<small>BTW, I think `nvc` inherited some bugs from PGI so you might generally have a better experience using `PrgEnv-aocc` (AMD's clang, which seems pretty close to upstream clang in behavior). `PrgEnv-cray` seems to have more mods to upstream clang, but both build libceed shared (default) or static without warnings....</small>
