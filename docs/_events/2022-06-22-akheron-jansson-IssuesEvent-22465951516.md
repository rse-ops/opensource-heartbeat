<p>Is there python support or compatibility for Jansson?</p><small>We have a C library that uses jansson, and we are looking into creating a python wrapper for our C API using ctypes. One issue I'm running into is how to pass the `json_t` object around from python to the shared library in C. It would be useful to be able to call into the `json_object` or `json_dumps` Jansson calls from our python wrapper class, or have a translation between Python's native JSON and the jansson C library. ...</small><a href='https://github.com/akheron/jansson/issues/618' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
