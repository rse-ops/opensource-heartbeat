<small>I just got back to this email from CEA, we run into this issue with RPATHs as well, and usually resolve it by having a list of "system paths" that never get added to the DT_NEEDED section even if it can cause ordering problems.  It's not necessarily ideal as you point out, but it means the user asked to slice their own invocations of flux by the way they set their paths and invoked us, rather than us reordering things for them at least....</small>
