<small>Oh I was figuring you would cap the delay at 10s or so (or whatever makes sense).  If we need to make it tunable, then I would add a command that lets you sets the start, multiplicative factor, and cap instead of only allowing only a non-adaptive delay to be configured.  But I'm not sure its needed....</small>
