<small>> @dylan-copeland I'm checking for the presence of the gslib folder to determine if the mfem dependencies need to be removed. If the -mg option is used, and there is no gslib folder, I assume that the previous compilation was with -m, and delete the mfem libraries prior to compilation. Is this ok?...</small>
