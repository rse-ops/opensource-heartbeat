<small>> Before the jobs in DEPEND state get released, the system instance is restarted or shut down and the jobs in DEPEND state get loaded back in, but they never get released with dependency_remove () because there are no currently running jobs to release them. Thus, they remain in DEPEND state forever, but new jobs can be submitted and things work as expected once the plugin gets loaded....</small>
