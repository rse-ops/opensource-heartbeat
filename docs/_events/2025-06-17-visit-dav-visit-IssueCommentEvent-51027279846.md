<small>> Here's a question: the query output object for Spatial Extents queries is a single entry with key = 'extents', and value an array/vector of the values. With the changes to the output string, should the output object (XmlResult) be modified to use the XMin/XMax, etc keys instead of just 'extents'? If so, this would possibly be more of a problem, even if it is the better way to report....</small>
