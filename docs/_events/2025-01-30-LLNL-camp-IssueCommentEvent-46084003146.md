<small>We may have a file that we redistribute from LLVM that has that, but the SPDX identifier in all the files I wrote should be BSD-3-Clause.  I don't mind the format, though It's more verbose than we need.  Will help get this straightened out if I can.  Really sorry I didn't get to this sooner, strep completely laid me flat last week....</small>
