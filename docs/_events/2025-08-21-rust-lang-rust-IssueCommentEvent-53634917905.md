<small>I believe the `compute_*` and `sm_*` semantics are consistently represented in this PR, and that single-invocation multi-target behavior is a major feature that would not entirely supplant ability to build kernels and device code using `--target=nvptx64-nvidia-cuda`. I think a similar `amdgcn_target_feature` would make sense....</small>
