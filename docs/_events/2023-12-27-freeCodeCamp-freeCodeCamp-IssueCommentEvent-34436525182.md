<small>I don't think we should displace any critical functionality (navbar, instructions, editable region, or submission button) to make room for the progress bar higher on the page. I don't see the progress bar as required to interact with the lesson content, and thus should have lower priority for placement when compared to those 4 critical elements I listed above....</small>
