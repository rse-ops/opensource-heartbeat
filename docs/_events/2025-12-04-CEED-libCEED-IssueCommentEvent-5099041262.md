<small>In particular, the `v*pd` ("packed double") instructions, which I expect GCC is indeed emitting. I like to use Linux `perf` and then look at the hot instructions. If those are `v*pd`, then vectorization has been effective. What does upstream clang do on your kernels? Is there a reason you are using legacy icc?...</small>
