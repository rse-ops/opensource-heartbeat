<small>I'm assuming the audience that cares about repo size will always be using a shallow clone? I just want to make sure everyone here knows it's not possible to actually shrink the (non-shallow) repo size without invalidating old hashes. It is possible to split the history, but it changes hashes, which is confusing for people who have clones lying around and disrupts workflows that depend on existence of old hashes. I have experience doing such things, though it isn't a decision to make lightly and I'm not recommending it....</small>
