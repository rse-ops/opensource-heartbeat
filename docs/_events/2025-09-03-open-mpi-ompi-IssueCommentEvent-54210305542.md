<small>Thanks for checking this stuff out in its early state @dalcinl.  some of the above functions have been implemented but are sitting in various states in PRs.  some of these should be defined - like ```MPI_Wtick``` and the aint related functions so i'll see what's going on.  As for the fromint/toint that seems like an excellent project for a AI LLM.  I'll see what can be done there....</small>
