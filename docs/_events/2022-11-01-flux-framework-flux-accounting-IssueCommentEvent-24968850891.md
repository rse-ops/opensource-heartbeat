<small>As I think about how to test this, I am wondering how it might be possible to test for consistent priority values, which is what I have been doing currently. I guess I could change the sharness tests to just check that the job receives a priority value (and not compare to a specific value), and that's it. The age factor is sure to change the integer priorities that I currently test for, and I'm not sure I can guarantee it stay the same in between runs. ...</small>
