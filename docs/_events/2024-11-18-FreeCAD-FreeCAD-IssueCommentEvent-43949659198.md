<small>Aakriti has moved on from our research group to a new role. I can rebase this branch, but it'll have to become a new PR since we can't update the source branch. Feedback on the questions above would be helpful for rebasing/updating other work she did this summer -- I don't understand the vision for taking solver support out of the FEM workbench other than to fork the whole workbench or to design a new plugin system....</small>
