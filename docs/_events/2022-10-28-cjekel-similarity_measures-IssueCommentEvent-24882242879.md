<small>Here is an example of minimizing DTW to fit a model in pytorch https://github.com/cjekel/similarity_measures/blob/dtwtorch/torch_DTW_demo.ipynb The resulting fit is actually pretty good, although it is not cheap to compute the DTW distance and derivatives this way for 150 data points on each path....</small>
