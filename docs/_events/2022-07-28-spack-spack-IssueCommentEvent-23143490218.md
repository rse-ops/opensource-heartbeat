<small>Ok sorry for the noise -- but now it appears that spackbot is working.  So if you want to fix style on your PR (and it's fixable) you'll be able to ask it to do so.  This PR was particularly interesting for testing as @brandon-feder is a first-time contributors and we had a harder time getting spackbot to work for this PR.  Sorry for the noise!...</small>
