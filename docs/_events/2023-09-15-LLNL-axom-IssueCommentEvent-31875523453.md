<small>I can't get it to build mfem yet, because hypre has a problem building.  I'm sure I need to change the spack setup to properly point it to the system netlib-lapack.  TPLs build when I use `~mfem` and `^cuda+allow-unsupported-compilers`.  And this also builds, so there is something still different between this build environment and the build failure I'm seeing....</small>
