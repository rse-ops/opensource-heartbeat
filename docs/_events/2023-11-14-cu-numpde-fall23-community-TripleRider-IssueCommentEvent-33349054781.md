<small>Presentation and proposal look good. Are you planning to work independently or in a group? There are a number of topics you can explore, but I would encourage in some form looking at resolution versus cost. SU2 is a finite volume method with a number of "limiters" (a technique to effect nonlinear stability). You could examine the effect of limiters on shock problems or on smooth problems (e.g., vortex shedding). (Limiters are "easy" to design for problems that are all-shock, but they have an effect on smooth regions that needs to be balanced with resolution of the shock.)...</small>
