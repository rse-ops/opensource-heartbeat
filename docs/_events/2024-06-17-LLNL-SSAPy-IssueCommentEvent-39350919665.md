<small>We've been using the workaround for a while and I also suspect that it's needed because of how we use `setup.py`. We don't have a way to install a development version of SSAPy that references the local code rather than the installed version. I totally agree that we should migrate to pip. We just haven't had the person power to do that as of yet....</small>
