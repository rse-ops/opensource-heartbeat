<small>> @corbett5 This PR was an attempt to fix a problem we were having on GPU systems. There were some stack traces that indicated that `Array<string>` was causing some sort of memory error....but it ended up not being the issue. Still...wondering if we should disallow `LvArray::Array<string>` as they shouldn't really ever go onto the GPU....</small>
