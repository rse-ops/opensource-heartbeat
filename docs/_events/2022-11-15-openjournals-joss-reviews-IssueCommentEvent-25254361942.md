<small>:wave: Thanks for this submission. Could you be more specific about who is the target audience for this software? Ice sheet models like [PISM](https://pism.io) have fast viscoelastic response calculation (see [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3189/172756407782871567)) and models that don't yet have such a module would strongly prefer a library interface to executables. Part of the audience identification is whether a purely elastic model is sufficient, given that viscoelastic response is significant on the time scale of ice sheet models....</small>
