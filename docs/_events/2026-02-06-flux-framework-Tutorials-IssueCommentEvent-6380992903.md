<small>@wihobbs the tutorial content does not need to be under the less permissive GNU license. We _want_ people to take it and modify. My preference would be to have MIT here, or MIT/Apache 2. Of course I'm sure this would need to be a Flux meeting item, so let's hold on merging and can bring up at a future meeting....</small>
