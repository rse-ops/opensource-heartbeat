<small>Thanks for building this example. I think we could add a section to the README (or other place in the docs) with recommended demonstrations. That could be further split into simple demos and featured production apps/libraries. In this case, I'd almost say we can include it in the rsmpi repo directly, but that might require some labor to ensure it's tested in CI. Feel free to make a PR either way (just docs or making it a demo that's tested on at least one platform)....</small>
