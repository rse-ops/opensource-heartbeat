<small>It seems like this one might be a mistake in ordering the priorities.  Possibly not providing the cmake enough information from the wrapper to know it should override.  Does it do what you want if you explicitly set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix you want>` rather than using the wrapper? That would help narrow down where I mixed up the logic....</small>
