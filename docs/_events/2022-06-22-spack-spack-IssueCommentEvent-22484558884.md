<small>Ah, that's reasonable but unfortunate.  I don't really want to, but maybe we need a new apple-llvm package that provides virtuals for libllvm and libclang or similar? I'm not sure, it's a bit messy, not sure we can really do anything reasonable to translate apple versions to llvm versions though....</small>
