<small>Yeah, I can rebase. I'm having trouble finding docs for a development workflow for stdarch. The [rustc josh docs](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/external-repos.html?highlight=stdarch#performing-push) describe making PRs to rust-lang/rust. I would like to build stdarch and use it with either `+nightly` or `+stage1` to test external crates that actually use the GPU (which CI does not yet do)....</small>
