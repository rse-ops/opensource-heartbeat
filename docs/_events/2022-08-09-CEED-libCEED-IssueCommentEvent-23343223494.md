<small>@jedbrown @tzanio, since we have the CEED6AM meeting this week, I think we have a chance to finally make a decision here. I think that if we can't find someone who can do the massive fixes + ongoing  basic maintance that the OCCA backend requires, I think we should go ahead with this PR and remove the OCCA backend. We can always revive it from Git history if someone wants to revive the backend in the future....</small>
