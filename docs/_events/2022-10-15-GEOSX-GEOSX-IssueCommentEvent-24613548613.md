<small>@CusiniM @klevzoff I do have a question as to whether or not we could have a generic kernel that will perform the stencil looping, and then call member functions of the specific kernel for single phase or multiphase. Or, we could just pass the body of the loop in a lambda. It doesn't seem hard to do...but perhaps we haven't done it for a reason?...</small>
