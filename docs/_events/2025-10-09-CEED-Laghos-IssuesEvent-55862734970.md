<p>Confusion about the results obtained by specifying parameters for Laghos.</p><small>When I specified the number of cores, I found that the more cores I specified, the longer the program ran and the worse the results. What is the reason for this. For example, when my - np is 1, the time for each item(CG, Force..) is the shortest and the rate is the highest. At - np 64, the results were actually very poor....</small><a href='https://github.com/CEED/Laghos/issues/189' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
