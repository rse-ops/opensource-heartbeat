<small>Any ideas to mitigate the issue of tests being redundant, so that when the `add` function is edited, they don't have to manually update/delete two duplicate tests? There could be two functions, like `add` and `square`, one with a doctest and one with `#[test]`, but that's a few more lines....</small>
