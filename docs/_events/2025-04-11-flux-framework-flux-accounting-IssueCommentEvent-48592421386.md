<small>One of the things I think some feedback would be especially helpful for would be how `job.state.inactive` iterates through jobs as they complete. You'll notice that I use a `while` loop here to iterate through an association's inactive jobs (if there is more than one  held job) in the case that maybe the first job does not meet all requirements to be released by the plugin....</small>
