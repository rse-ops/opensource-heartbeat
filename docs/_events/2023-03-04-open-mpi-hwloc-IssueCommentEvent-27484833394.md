<small>If you end up accepting something like this, and if it uses `FetchContent`, PLEASE ensure that package managers can disable that so that we do not have to patch your build.  Distro people and packaging people do NOT want `hwloc` to fetch its own dependencies -- they need a way to do that themselves....</small>
