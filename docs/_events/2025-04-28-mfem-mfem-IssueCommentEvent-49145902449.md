<small>Thanks @JacobLotz for the explanation. I agree that we can just close this PR for now. Of course, we can always make this change later, if we find a test that needs it. Although it is a very small PR, my concern is that the changes are difficult to understand without an example to demonstrate the problem. We can keep this PR in mind if we run into issues with the edge to knot mapping....</small>
