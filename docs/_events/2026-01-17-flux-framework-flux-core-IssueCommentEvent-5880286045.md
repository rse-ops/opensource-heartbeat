<small>Oh, hey, didn't we have a problem a while back where the flux systemd instance was getting killed when someone logged in and out of a node?  I thought we had a workaround in place for that, but don't recall the details.  Maybe the 90s default stop timeout is in effect for the system unit that contains the user instance?...</small>
