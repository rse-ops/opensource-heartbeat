<small>This is really disruptive because many HDF5 users also use `perf` for profiling. Lack of an upstream fix means that packagers for each distribution will be making their own work-arounds and this divergence will create a poor user experience and support thicket. HDF5 maintainers: if you lack the time to fix right now, can you please comment here with your preferred name so packagers can rename consistently until an upstream fix arrives?...</small>
