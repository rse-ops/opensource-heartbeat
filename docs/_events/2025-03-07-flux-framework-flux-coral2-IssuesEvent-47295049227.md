<p>`dws2jgf` does not apply properties to all nodes</p><small>Problem: when `flux-dws2jgf` writes out nodes, it neglects to output properties for all nodes that are not in DWS. For instance, on Tioga, `tioga[42-43]` are not associated with a rabbit, but they are listed in `resource.toml` and are assigned to queue `mi300a`. But `flux dws2jgf` wrote them out without assigning any properties whatsoever....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-coral2/issues/311' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
