<small>Cool, I'll do the followup PR then, I ended up doing a few other things with it so I think that makes more sense.  The new PR will take care of allowing other python versions but ensuring the whole thing still runs on 3.6, and clean out some vestigial stuff, which means I'm going to have to change some versions.  Our mypy is currently old enough it can't even read from pyproject.toml, and some related things.  Anyway, I'm going to close this and re-propose as a PR to follow your original @vsoch....</small>
