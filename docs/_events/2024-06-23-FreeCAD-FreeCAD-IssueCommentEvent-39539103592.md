<small>Thanks for the pointer to fcVM. Does it actually use the FEM Workbench? In the screenshots, I see it says "fcVM workbench" and does not inherit menus/icons from FEM Workbench. I see fcVM-specific dialogs for materials (like yield stress) instead of using the existing materials infrastructure. Is your vision for the existing FEM Workbench solvers to move out into the likes of "CalculiX Workbench" and "Elmer Workbench" while using core, or to have them as addons that show up as a different solver in the existing FEM Workbench? Are there any examples or an in-progress branch with the organization you want? If not, would it be sensible for us to develop Ratel solver support in a branch until core is ready to move our solver-specific things elsewhere? (I understand the branch might not be merged, but I want to avoid duplication or heavy refactoring outside of our domain of expertise.)...</small>
