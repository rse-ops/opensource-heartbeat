<p>examples/fluids: unstructured distance function</p><small>Computing distance from walls is necessary for some turbulence models and to create initial conditions for which the initial transient is not too extreme. The Eikonal equation offers a proper way to solve this equation, but it's difficult to solve scalably using variational methods. [This paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/1.8626) compares several strategies and suggests a simple method:...</small><a href='https://github.com/CEED/libCEED/issues/1081' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
