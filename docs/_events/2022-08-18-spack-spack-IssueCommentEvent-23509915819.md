<small>@tgamblin, @becker33, if you get a chance to weigh in on this it would be appreciated.  It's the spack-side half of something @vsoch has been setting up for Flux, and potentially other projects later, to help us keep our spack packages tested (by maintaining them in our own repositories) and up to date in spack by making it easy to propagate the updates back....</small>
