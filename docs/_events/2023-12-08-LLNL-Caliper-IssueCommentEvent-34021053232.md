<small>Hi @vsurjadidjaja , thanks again for the PR! I fixed a few things in the top-level CMakeLists.txt that were still somehow reverting some changes in the main branch, but otherwise it looks good to me! I'll merge it in. I'll try to find a machine with LDMS here where I can give this a spin....</small>
