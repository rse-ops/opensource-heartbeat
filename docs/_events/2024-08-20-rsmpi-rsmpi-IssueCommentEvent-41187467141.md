<small>I'm more fond of the `imports_granularity` and `group_imports` than with changing default styling in other cases. And with `wrap_comments` preserving lines that contain URLs, manual wrapping will often be necessary anyway (I assume everyone has a key for this). Want to make a PR with only the last three lines in your suggested configuration?...</small>
