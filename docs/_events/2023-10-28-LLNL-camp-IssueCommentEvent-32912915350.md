<small>Thanks for the PR @rakesroy.  I'm a bit concerned that `.type` isn't documented for ROCM versions below 6, do we need an ifdef here for pre-6 versions or is it just undocumented in 5.*?  The changelog looks like it's changing, so I'm guessing we need the ifdef or similar to maintain compatibility across versions right?...</small>
