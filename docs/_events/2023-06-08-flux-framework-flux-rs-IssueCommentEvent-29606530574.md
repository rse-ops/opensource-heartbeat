<small>It's a very minimal repo, just there for the classic rust style `<crate>`/`<crate>-sys` split where the former is the rustic wrappers and higher-level API and the `-sys` crate is the low-level bindgen setup and so-forth.  It might be easier to start there since there are less deps, but it has very little in it....</small>
