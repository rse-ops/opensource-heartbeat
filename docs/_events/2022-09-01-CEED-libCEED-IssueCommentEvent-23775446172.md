<small>Also, we could experiment on the Julia side first, but we could map the domain $\eta \in (0, \infty)$ to $s \in (-1, 1)$ with a transform like $s = 2 \tanh(\alpha \eta) - 1$ for any chosen $\alpha$. That would be a small code change and avoid needing to specify $\eta_{\max}$. I'd expect $\alpha = 1/3$ would have decent approximation properties and could be chosen universally....</small>
