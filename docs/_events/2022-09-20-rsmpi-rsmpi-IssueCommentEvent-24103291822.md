<small>You'll have to read the docs for your cluster. `srun` is part of SLURM, which is a common resource manager for HPC systems. There are several others. Your cluster should have documentation, and you can ask the cluster admins if not. These tools have nothing to do with Rust, but the Rust executables can be run like any other....</small>
