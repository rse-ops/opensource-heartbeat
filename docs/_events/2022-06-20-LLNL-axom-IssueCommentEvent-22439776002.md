<small>@kanye-quest , @kennyweiss , I expect to approve this tomorrow early.  I do have a few comments that I'd like addressed, most of which have to do with the Doxygen and/or obvious typos.  I flagged a few uses of `std::vector`, not for this PR.  If they should be converted to SLAM, that should go in a subsequent PR....</small>
