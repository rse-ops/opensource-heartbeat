<small>+1 with merging @trws  @milroy -- we've reviewed it together, and looked at it a few times (I looked at it in Feb as well). The changes make sense to me and seem correct overall.  I haven't had a chance to test it locally at my end, and I will do that soon -- but we don't need to hold on merging this for my testing. We can always open an issue if something comes up when I try it out. ...</small>
