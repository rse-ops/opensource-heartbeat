<small>The number of function evaluations will depend on several factors (e.g., tolerances, nonlinear/linear solver, etc.) and dynamics of the problem your are solving. What nonlinear/linear solver are you using? If using the dense or banded linear solver, are you supplying a Jacobian function? What is the evolution of the system like e.g., does the problem have an initial transient period followed by slow dynamics or tend toward a steady state?...</small>
