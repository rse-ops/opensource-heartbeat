<small>I think this is really an author preference matter. In general, I'd say benchmarking the official version is best. I'm not sure how much performance is expected to have changed from earlier, nor whether it's the same machine. For dense operations, the relative performance of MKL to BLIS and OpenBLAS is [routinely benchmarked](https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/docs/Performance.md)....</small>
