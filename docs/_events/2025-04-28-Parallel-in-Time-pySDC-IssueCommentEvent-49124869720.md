<small>I also strongly support this idea.  This project would make PySDC more accessible, including to students at other institutions (like mine) who would be interested, and it would help open up collaborations with other Python packages (like PyAMG, which implements algebraic multigrid, AMG, for spatial solves, where I'm a co-developer)....</small>
