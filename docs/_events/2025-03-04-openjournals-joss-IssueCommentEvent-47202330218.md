<small>I agree with @sneakers-the-rat, and would go further, that people should know (and thus be defensive toward) the use of Copilot and similar products can automate what would assuredly be copyright violation if a human did it. For example, it reproduces substantial portions of SuiteSparse (an LGPL library) with copyright stripped and only trivial cosmetic changes ([article from 2022](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-generation-ownership)), and this question of whether slight obfuscation is defense against copyright infringement is the subject of [ongoing class-action litigation](https://www.saverilawfirm.com/our-cases/github-copilot-intellectual-property-litigation). (Obfuscation is not a defense against copyright infringement by a human, which is why [clean-room design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean-room_design) exists.) Companies are banking on use of such products being sufficiently ubiquitous they can obtain a legislative solution if courts rule against them. They may be successful, and yet I object on ethical grounds....</small>
