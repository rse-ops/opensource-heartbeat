<small>It seems to me the benefit of FlexiBLAS is to delay choice of which implementation is used until runtime when linking shared libs. As such, it's great when packaged by distributions (and Rust can use system BLAS), but what is the benefit when linking statically? It takes a while to build and users just want their app to run....</small>
