<small>Since timestamps aren't guaranteed unique, using them to recreate the original event order is not reliable and could put events in an order that does not make sense.  However, the aforementioned job manager journal does give you the events for all jobs in the order posted so adding a sequence number to that stream may help if that's the goal....</small>
