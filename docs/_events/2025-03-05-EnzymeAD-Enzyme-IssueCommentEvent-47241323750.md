<small>Is it appropriate to add a test that pulls in rsmpi? That would require building a Rust toolchain using this Enzyme and then `cargo test` (which would build rsmpi, assuming an MPI implementation is available somewhere in the CI environment). I'm supposing that "soon", people will be getting their Enzyme-enable Rust from rustup, and that will increase interest in support for differentiable rsmpi, etc....</small>
