<small>@slabasan : as discussed, reverted the change around Arctic Sound (will submit separate PR), and removed the `<Inte/AMD> is idx` prints, and moved the number of registered platforms print to the variorum log instead. Let me know if I missed anything, I believe this is ready to go. Thank you!...</small>
