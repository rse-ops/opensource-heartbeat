<p>Support for 64bit ids</p><small>Until now, we have gotten by without 64bit ids. 32bit worked, since no operations/filter made decisions based on the total number of cells. With filters like statistics, that has changed. There is another branch where this has been tested, e.i., using 64bit ids with vtkm works just fine....</small><a href='https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent/issues/431' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
