<small>The main reason I decided to drop is b/c I didn't go into `stdio` or (soon to be) command directives.  So I think in time, there should be a `flux mini batch` tutorial to basically go over how to use it and some of the most common options/usage.  Such a tutorial would just assume users know why they would want to use it....</small>
