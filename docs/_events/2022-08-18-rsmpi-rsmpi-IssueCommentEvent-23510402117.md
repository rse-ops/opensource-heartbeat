<small>I see those `MPIX_` functions are available in MPICH-4.1a1 as well. Is there a good place to look for complete examples that can handle vanishing processes? I don't have a sense for whether that's a realistic mode for rsmpi, though if we can make it safer using the type system, maybe it'll be a place people will seek out for writing this sort of fault-tolerant MPI....</small>
