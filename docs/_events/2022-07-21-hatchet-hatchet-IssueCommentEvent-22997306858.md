<small>Hi @jrmadsen. This sounds great! I also want to mention [Pipit](https://github.com/hpcgroup/pipit), where we are adding readers for analyzing full traces without collapsing them into a call graph/tree. It's still work in progress but we have added readers for HPCToolkit, OTF2, and we are working on an Nsight reader. And we are also developing a user-facing API for analysis....</small>
