<small>You're sharing screenshots that don't show the code. If the code is open, it would be much more useful to link to the code. I see it's part of the `blst` package, and that `G1Affine` is a newtype of [`blst_p1_affine`](https://docs.rs/blst/0.3.10/blst/struct.blst_p1_affine.html), which contains `u64` arrays. You can send this type directly with rsmpi....</small>
