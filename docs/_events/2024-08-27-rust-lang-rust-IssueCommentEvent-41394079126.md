<small>Sorry about the big delay getting back to this. I've updated this PR to remove the `float_mul_add_fast` feature and associated safe functions, keeping the `intrinsics::fmuladdf{32,64}` with associated tests and Miri support (thanks Ralf, for the guidance). I think it's reviewable now....</small>
