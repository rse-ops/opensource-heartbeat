<small>Reading through this today, it seems there has been a lot of talking past each other. I'd hope everyone here agrees that the last three in George's four examples https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-issues/issues/846#issuecomment-2035945121 are invalid. The first case could be made to work, but it's really dangerous for users to work with that semantic and what is the value? If someone is advocating for that case to be valid, it would be useful for them to suggest a code sample indicating how it would be useful....</small>
