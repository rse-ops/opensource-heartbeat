<small>rust-gpu is very interesting, but I don't think it would be suitable for a new libCEED backend since its both quite inactive and applies only to Rust. Unfortunately the WebGPU spec also doesn't specify SPIR-V, only WGSL. Currently the tooling for WGSL is lacking a lot. SPIR-V is only interesting since the two main implementations support it out of spec. ...</small>
