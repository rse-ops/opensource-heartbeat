<small>After making it work with `icpc 2021.7.0` and updating the compiler I noticed this message: "The Intel(R) C++ Compiler Classic (ICC) is deprecated and will be removed from product release in the second half of 2023.  The Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler (ICX) is the recommended compiler moving forward. Please transition to use this compiler. Use '-diag-disable=10441' to disable this message."....</small>
