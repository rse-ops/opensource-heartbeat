<small>I've created a virtual environment and pip installed v1.8.5 of Merlin. I then ran one of the same tests that was failing because of numpy and it failed again. I'm assuming this means the change is not backwards compatible here? However, if we implement the change to fix this then there are no external changes to our API so I feel like bumping to v2.0.0 seems wrong and there are no features added so bumping to v1.10.0 seems wrong....</small>
