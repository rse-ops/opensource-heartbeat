<small>Okay.  We should put this discussion of what to do with the datatype support in one of our upcoming tuesday meetings.  Meanwhile, I think this PR is good to go - modulo commit squashing.    Its clear from the initial commit message that this was one of several pieces of work that need to be done before we can claim complete (or reasonably complete) support for big count.  Also getting this in to main now will help flush out any problems it may cause well before we branch for the next major release.  If there's some fundamental issue with providing bigcount support in the datatype engine we can modify the binding generating infrastructure to not generate the bigcount variants....</small>
