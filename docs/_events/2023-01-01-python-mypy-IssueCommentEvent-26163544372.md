<small>Ok that does work!  The sense of those options is... kind of confusing.  So `follow_imports = 'skip'` means "don't follow imports of this package, but if it has stubs go ahead", and `follow_imports_for_stubs` means "the `follow_imports` option ALSO applies to stubs"?  Do I have that right?...</small>
