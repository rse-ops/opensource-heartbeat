<small>We wanted libCEED to be usable with unusual toolchains and with more user control, but without needing to edit files. CMake requires platform/toolchain files for this purpose, and both it and autotools run lots of checks at configure time. You could set `OPT=$(CFLAGS)` and unset `CFLAGS` if you want the convenience of not specifying `-fPIC`....</small>
