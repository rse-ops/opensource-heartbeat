<small>I've run some tests to check compatability between HDF5 versions. I created `multi_ucd3d.h5` with Silo 4.11.3RC and HDF5-1.14.0 and then used `browser` from an old install of Silo 4.10 on CZ to read it and it read everything fine. I need to test checksumming and compression under the same conditions. But, this does indicate older silo/hdf5 combinations will read files produced by newer silo/hdf5 combinations....</small>
