<small>I'm revisiting this PR after last month's release and I think it's gotten a little out of scope of the issue described in #262 and probably a little difficult to review. Nonetheless, I think there are some important fixes that should be considered for the plugin, so I think I'll close this PR, and open subsequent smaller PRs instead....</small>
