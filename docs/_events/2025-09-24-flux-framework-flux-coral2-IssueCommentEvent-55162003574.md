<small>Sorry for the delay on this. I'm not sure what the best approach is. I'd definitely want the RPM build to fail and also some tests to be skipped if the module isn't found, but we could probably add an optional flag to the configure line to make kubernetes a hard requirement, and then add that flag to the RPM spec....</small>
