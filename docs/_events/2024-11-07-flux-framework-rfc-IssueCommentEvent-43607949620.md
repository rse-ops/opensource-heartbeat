<small>In #5378, @ryanday36 mentioned an alternate idea to a standby flag: allow a duration _range_ in jobspec, where a standby job would specify a min < max duration and the job would be eligible for preemption after the min duration expires.  For traditional standby, min = 0, but it would allow for a job to request to get a minimum amount of work done before preemption.  It seems like we discussed this and decided it was a better idea than the flag but I can't find anything to cite here....</small>
