<small>CHAI is used successfully on Windows, though in a CPU-only configuration. It uses CMake as its build system, which is supported on Windows, so the build process should be very similar. You might have to select a specific generator (e.g. cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64) to generate a visual studio solution file, for example. Or supposedly, in visual studio there is built in support for CMake projects (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170). Other generators are listed here if you don't use visual studio: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html. ...</small>
