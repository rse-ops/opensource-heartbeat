<small>@white238, requesting help with a test. I had to disable a test that verifies an error check works as expected. It uses the `EXPECT_DEATH` gtest macro. It works fine when I launch the executable myself, but fails when the ctest launcher is executing the entire suite. Is there a way to get this unit test of the error check to operate?...</small>
