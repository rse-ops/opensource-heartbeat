<small>Does it manifest as a dialog box prompting you to select a serial device, but then displaying "Failed to connect serial. Please try again" after selection? If so, it's likely because the current user doesn't have permission to connect to the serial port. You need to add the current user to the uucp group (this worked successfully on my Arch Linux) or the dialout group (this might be necessary on Fedora or Ubuntu)....</small>
