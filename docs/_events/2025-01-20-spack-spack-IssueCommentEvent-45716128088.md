<small>I think this is correct. I think *technically*, code generated by `amdclang` should have a link dependency on some piece of the rocm runtime, but we should model that with runtime injection (like `gcc` and the synthetic `gcc-runtime` package), not with a link dependency on `llvm-amdgpu` (which includes way too much stuff)....</small>
