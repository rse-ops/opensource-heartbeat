<small>It might be worth pulling out some of the changes here into their own PRs. (Session handling, tests, the creation of models, etc...) As part of reviewing this PR I'm going to work on a minimal consolidation of the config into a single entry point and then that might be a good place for us to add on to incrementally. I like a lot of what this PR is doing, but I'm hesitant about adding a models library since that breaks with the existing module naming scheme....</small>
