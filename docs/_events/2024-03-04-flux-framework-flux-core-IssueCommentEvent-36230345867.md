<small>I missed this until today.  Probably a reasonable decision, although I'm still of the opinion that we would be better off with something like jsonschema that we can use to _generate parsing and generation code_ as a way to make communicating over the flux overlay more practical without having to call the C routines in the long term.  Not a priority, but this would probably be the place to come back to if someone needs to do that in the future....</small>
