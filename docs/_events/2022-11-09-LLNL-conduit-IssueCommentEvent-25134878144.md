<small>Another question:  A common case (that we are showing in the example) is for the user to create the new topo and all dependent fields, etc. in the same mesh.  In this case, unless the user specifies a fields_prefix, there will be overwritten fields.  Do we care?  Should we make a default fields_prefix?...</small>
