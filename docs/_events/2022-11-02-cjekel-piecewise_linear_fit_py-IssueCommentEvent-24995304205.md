<small>I never ended up merging this feature request for mixed degrees. Take a look at https://github.com/cjekel/piecewise_linear_fit_py/issues/41 using a `degree_list=[0,1]`.  It was a rather small commit https://github.com/cjekel/piecewise_linear_fit_py/commit/ef58aaa93d1f07f643456bfdbc5f523ab751ee47 I just didn't get around to finishing the grunt work to make sure it didn't break any of the other behavior. Happy to accept a PR to get this in sooner....</small>
