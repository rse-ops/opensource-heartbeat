<small>Ah, thanks for clarifying. I'm personally not a fan of depending on transitive naming and instead in favor of removing the `static` feature from `libceed-sys`. I still think it would be important to have a shared build available due to #1694, but that could be a non-default feature called `shared` or `dynamic` or similar (re-exported or not)....</small>
