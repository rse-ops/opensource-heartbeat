<small>Thank you @drupol, Typst indeed looks great. I'm not sure yet if we want to switch to Typst at this point for this particular paper, but I'll definitely be using it for my other work, for example I recently needed to add math to a Markdown document and convert it to PDF, and Typst would have been perfect, so next time I'll go straight to it....</small>
