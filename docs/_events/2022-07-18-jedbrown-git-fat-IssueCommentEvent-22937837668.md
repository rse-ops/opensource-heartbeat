<small>git-lfs was created after git-fat. Many people find git-fat simpler, but I unfortunately don't have time to maintain this project and no longer have a need to use it so git-lfs is probably a better choice. (What makes maintenance hard is that people want to make changes that would break backward compatibility, though we don't have great test coverage of that.)...</small>
