<small>It depends on what you mean by policy in this context. We don't support different match policies, currently, but we do support different queueing policies.  We've given some thought to how to do something like this in the past, because it would be an efficiently improvement certainly.  It ended up on the back burner largely because we get a somewhat similar effect by running a user-level flux instance that isn't node-exclusive under the node-exclusive system scheduler.  This would let us be much more flexible though....</small>
