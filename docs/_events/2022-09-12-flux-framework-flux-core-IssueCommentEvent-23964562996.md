<small>thought I'd try to deprecate `flux_job_list()` and `flux_job_list_inactive()` really quick.  Updating the function calls with rpcs in `cmd/flux-job` relatively easy and pretty much all tests pass (1 test adjustment to deal with error check no longer handled by `libjob`).  Warnings from tests in `libjob/test` can be dealt with via removing the tests....</small>
