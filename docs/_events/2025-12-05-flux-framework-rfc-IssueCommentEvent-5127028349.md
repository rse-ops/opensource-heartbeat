<small>Dang, it sounded like such a good idea, and it looks like it works for HPCToolkit on gitlab.  It looks like roles aren't easy to make visible on github either.  I suppose a list is fine, as long as it's a single place, that's where lists burn is if they have to be maintained in multiple places without a way to ensure they stay in sync....</small>
