<small>@sajal-vt , I am seeing similar apex build errors with ROCm-5.5 (and ROCm-5.6).  For that matter, it also fails to build now with ROCm-5.4, which used to work for me a few weeks back.  I think there are multiple compile issues here.  I've opened a ticket on the apex github https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/apex/issues/115...</small>
