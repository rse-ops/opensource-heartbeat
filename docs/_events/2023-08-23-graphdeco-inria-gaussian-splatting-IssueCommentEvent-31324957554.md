<small>I tested the fix on "lego" and "ship", both seemed to work exactly as before. Since the error metric doesn't penalize the model ending up flipped 180 degrees in world space, I would expect the PSNR to be exactly the same (I didn't check though). The only positive effect is compatibility with a custom initial point cloud....</small>
