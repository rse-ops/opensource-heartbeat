<small>It didn't occur to me until later, but in the same message it's interesting that `flux kvs dir --namespace $FLUX_KVS_NAMESPACE` also reported `unrecognized option '-N'` rather than `--namespace`.  if it happens to be straightforward probably good to report the version of the option the user supplied rather than the short form....</small>
