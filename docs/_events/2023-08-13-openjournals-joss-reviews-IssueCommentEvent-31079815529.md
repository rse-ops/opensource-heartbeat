<small>Sorry about the delay; I've been buried and need to decline more service requests. I'm willing to take this, but I'm going to ask for some build and design improvements to support "maintainable extension". This may not be universal, but I feel a clear pattern that JOSS submissions developed in languages other than Fortran have made leaps of progress on composition/usability/packaging over the past few years, and yet here we have lots of near-duplicate code in different directories with copy/modify-the-makefile and limited portability testing. You would not be wrong to say that these practices are accepted by many Fortran programmers, but as someone who [wrote a paper](https://jedbrown.org/files/BrownKnepleySmith-RuntimeExtensibilityAndLibrarizationOfSimulationSoftware-2014.pdf) on extensibility and "librarization" of simulation software and spends a lot of time dealing with externalities of such practices, it is a bit of a pet issue for me. I understand you may not want to make such changes (and I would understand that choice), but I'd ask that we find a different editor if that is the case....</small>
