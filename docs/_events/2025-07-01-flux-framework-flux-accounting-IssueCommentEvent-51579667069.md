<small>No, not a problem. I opened this PR mostly as an experiment to see if removing the duplicate `coverage.rc` that I had in flux-accounting's `checks_run.sh` (I think due to my my negligence in #644) would actually trigger the Python bindings from actually getting picked up by Codecov, but I'm still not seeing coverage there.
