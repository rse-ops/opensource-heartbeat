<small>To clarify, these changes are needed because I am going to deprecate `mpi3::communicator` _(re)assignment_. Which after a long thought I got to the conclusion that it doesn't play well with the MPI model. QMCPACK depended _accidentally_ (not in a fundamental way) on that feature and this PR fixes it....</small>
