<small>> Is that a "no, it does not mean that", or "no, files written by H5Z-ZFP with zfp 1.0.0 cannot be read by older versions"? I would hope that files written using any combination of zfp 0.5.x and 1.0.0 with any version of H5Z-ZFP would be readable by any other version. But older versions of H5Z-ZFP did not embed `ZFP_CODEC`, which you're hinting is now being done, so does that not somehow break compatibility?...</small>
