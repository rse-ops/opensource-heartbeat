<small>@bmhan12 - I ran into "yaml_parser->problem is NULL (missing)" recently in some other work when my `data` submodule was not up to date. When I went in and made sure it had "main" checked out rather than a detached HEAD, it worked. I don't know how it got into the detached HEAD state though....</small>
