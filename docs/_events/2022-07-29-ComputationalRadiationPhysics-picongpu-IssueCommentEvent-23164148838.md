<small>> Do I understand it correctly that this PR and the PR at ADIOS2 would both be necessary? So we would still write our IO/checkpointing logic in terms of openPMD/ADIOS2, but use SCR-enabled ADIOS2? And these changes inside PIConGPU are then necessary to have SCR running in the background?...</small>
