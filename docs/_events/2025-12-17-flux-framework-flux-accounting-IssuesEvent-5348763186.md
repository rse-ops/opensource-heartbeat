<p>storage: long-term/centralized/durable storage solutions for flux-accounting</p><small>@trws and I discussed offline that it might be nice to think about and eventually implement a long-term storage solution for flux-accounting and its contents. As it stands now, flux-accounting utilizes SQLite to store all user, bank, association, queue, and job data to complete its functions, which is lightweight and portable. Offering a more centralized storage option such as PostgreSQL (for which there exists a [Python](https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/) API to interface with such a DB) might be a nice evolution for this module, perhaps as a way to offer a center-wide solution for all things flux-accounting, like managing accounts, banks, projects, etc....</small><a href='https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-accounting/issues/793' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
