<small>This is long out of date, and a lot of the proposed components are unnecessary now due to improvements in the python-based job-manager `JournalConsumer` class and the ability to extend the command line via plugins. Maybe we'll still need an RFC for notifications, but it will look very different from this one. Closing....</small>
