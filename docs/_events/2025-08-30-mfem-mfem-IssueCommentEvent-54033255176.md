<small>@tepperly, the PR will be merged by the editor (@pazner in this case, as seen in the table added to the first post) when there are at least 2 approvals from people in the Reviewers team and after some additional testing (run nightly) in the `next` branch. The procedure is documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`: https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests -- we try to follow it closely but it's not set in stone....</small>
