<small>would you mind reconfiguring with the ```--enable-debug``` option and report the traceback?  should help narrow down which opal_argv_join is causing the behavior.   Also you may want to allocate a 2-element array of char ptrs and set the argv1[1] to NULL and see if that changes the behavior....</small>
