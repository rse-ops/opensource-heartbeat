<small>I haven't forgotten this WIP.  I just pushed up some more touches on the MeshConnections interface, and also my first swipe at the changes to the Mesh interface.  One thing I am doing there is separating out the calls for the getting the entity id numbers and the the orientation information.  I think the orientation information could use some rework as well, but for now I am adding more documentation on them and saving that for another day.  Please have a look and let me know what you think of th proposed interface changes....</small>
