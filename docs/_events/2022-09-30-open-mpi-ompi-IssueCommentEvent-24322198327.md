<small>It isn't quite that simple about these four info routines.  I'm working on a fix.  The macro name is misleading.  its actually checking to see if an internal "instance" of critical infrastructure has been set up.  That's where we get back to my previous comment.  Except for certain limited cases, if the app has not called MPI_Info _create, the infrastructure is not in place to handle the other info related calls except for certain limited input argument values....</small>
