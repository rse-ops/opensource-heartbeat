<small>It would also be nice to pass a YGM container to `dnnd::query()` and `dnnd::query_with_features()`, although this would require either (a) an internal copy of the contents to a temporary vector, or (b) a significant overhaul of `dndetail::dknn_batch_query_kernel`, neither of which seems desirable at this time....</small>
