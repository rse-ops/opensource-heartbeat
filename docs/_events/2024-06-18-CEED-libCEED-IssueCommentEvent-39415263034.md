<small>It's possible the derivative of the Riemann solver is not exact. If HLL gives quadratic, that would be a smoking gun. I would hope Newton convergence is similar with the different variable sets, even if not quadratic for the Riemann-type conditions. I wish it were easier to unit test this so we would at least have a record of what is quadratic and what is inexact....</small>
