<small>I'm not sure if it will be helpful or harmful for this issue, but the target export setup and various issues around it have been substantially reworked in the most recent releases of camp and umpire, and on develop in RAJA.  It may be worth trying with those, and if you are using spack ensuring that you use the packages for those three from the most recent develop version of spack, to see if the rework helped or not....</small>
