<small>@tgamblin, I agree on running those on develop, but am not 100% sure what the best way to actually *do that* is.  There are a couple of options, but for the moment leaving the full list there and pulling down the time with the parallelism PR seems a reasonable start, then we can prune after if things are still getting gummed up too badly.  Most recent push reinstates all the original versions....</small>
