<small>Yeah, maybe so.  I mean, we _could_ just be short sighted and say that one "permit" is always sufficient and there is no deny but then someone will inevitably want something more sophisticated and this will look...short sighted.  Maybe we should table this for now and I should not have hijacked @cmoussa1's issue....</small>
