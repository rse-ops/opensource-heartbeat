<small>Nice presentation and proposal write-up. For a specific algebraic solver, they have ML (the "old" algebraic multigrid) and MueLu (the "new" one). There should be examples of elasticity in the repository. (Elasticity is an important equation with some interesting properties for solvers.) You could set up a benchmark comparing ML with MueLu (and possibly we can run an equivalent setup with Ratel using Hypre, ML, and GAMG). (PETSc has bindings to ML, but not to MueLu, mainly because it takes a long time to compile MueLu and nobody has put in the work to write that interface.)...</small>
