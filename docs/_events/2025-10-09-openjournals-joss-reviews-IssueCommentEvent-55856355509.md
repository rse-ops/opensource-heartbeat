<small>Thanks @dostuffthatmatters and @abaer-kit. I'm personally sympathetic to the security/complexity issues (and would note that HPC facilities prefer to have people analyze/postprocess data from that facility to avoid egress/off-site transfer). From a usability standpoint, I see not much testing and a [list of error codes](https://auto-icon.gitlab-pages.dkrz.de/auto-icon/Userguide/Error-codes.html), but I think it's rarely going to provide enough information to diagnose and fix the problem from the client machine, which means someone has to manually log in and replicate an environment on the login node. As soon as you're doing that, you'd be better off submitting jobs from the login node. At least that has been my experience (with many HPC systems and applications/software stacks over the years). But I'd like to defer to people who work with ICON....</small>
