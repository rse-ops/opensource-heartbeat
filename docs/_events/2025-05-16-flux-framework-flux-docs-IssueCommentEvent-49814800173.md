<small>IMHO a new sheet (perhaps on the docs site) with the most frequently and most useful options could be nice for an "ever-expanding" list of examples. You could create one batch of 10  jobs (5 running, 3 scheduled, 2 completed, etc.) and use a varying list of `flux jobs` commands to list different lists of jobs based on the formats you discussed above? And we could start with the most basic examples and build on this whenever we think of another convenient example to have?...</small>
