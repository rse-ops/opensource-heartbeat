<small>Is there a mechanism for alerting spack users about this default change in behavior?  I would expect users of spack-based installs of newer Open MPI versions and using UCX PML within Open MPI would see a plunge in internode performance if they were using MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE, as Open MPI would switch to using the TCP BTL in those cases for internode messages....</small>
