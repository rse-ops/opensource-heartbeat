<small>I'm nervous about picking the "preferred" version of a package without interpreting any constraints. This works now because  cmake's preferred version is v3.31.9, but the second that flips to v4 it'll break since clingo-bootstrap@spack <= clingo@5.7.1 which conflicts with cmake@4....</small>
