<small>Ok, it looks like a `VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET` is a special case of an arbitrary polyhedron. Apparently, with just the points alone, and nothing else, a `VTK_CONVEX_POINT_SET` specifies the faces (and edges) of the resulting points using an [algorithm to extract the faces of the convex hull](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkOrderedTriangulator.html#details)....</small>
