<small>Could [dependencies](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-rfc/en/latest/spec_26.html) be of use here?   e.g. a  job that needs access to a particular persistent fs could submit with `--dependency=rabbit:mystuff`, and the job that is allocating the rabbit resources could satisfy that dependency once the fs is ready to use, letting the dependent jobs be scheduled?   We could come up with a custom scheme for these use cases if necessary....</small>
