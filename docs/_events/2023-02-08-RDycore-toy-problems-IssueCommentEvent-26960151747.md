<small>Is the Gmsh example I made for this problem not suitable? We can produce quad meshes the same way (structured or non-uniform, say, with refinement near the corners). That was like a 10 minute job, included labeled faces, and will be easy to modify. (If you're going to be creating meshes in Matlab and you want to use your Exodus writer, that's fine. But we surely don't need to convert Gmsh to Exodus or otherwise unnecessarily go through Exodus.)...</small>
