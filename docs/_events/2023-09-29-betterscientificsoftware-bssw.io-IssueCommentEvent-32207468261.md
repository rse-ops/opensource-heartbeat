<small>Well, so I dunno if you've paid much attention to #1830 but I have kinda sorta created a *preview* of sort for the internal docs. I have just gone to **Settings**->**GH Pages** and adjusted the branch from which it generates them. Now, thats not quite a preview because its *live*. But, I think its kinda ok because its primarily for internal consumption anyways....</small>
