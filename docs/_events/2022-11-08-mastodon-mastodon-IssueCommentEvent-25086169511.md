<small>From a usability standpoint, people aren't going to write both `#doi:10.1234/abc567 https://doi.org/10.1234/abc567` every time they reference a paper (so it can be clicked and find related conversations, and also just follow to the paper). Would it be too hard to only index `doi.org` addresses for search? I think a usability ideal would be to just write the URL and have clients render as `DOI:10.1234/abc5676` where the `DOI` part is like a hashtag (click gives search results) and the rest links through doi.org to the product....</small>
