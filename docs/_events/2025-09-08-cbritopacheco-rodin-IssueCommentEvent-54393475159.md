<small>@copilot I have fixed the syntax error and the test. Please finish it. Also most of these are just basic functionality tests which should be categorized as unit tests and moved to tests/unit/ under their respective path and file. So please separate the unit tests from the manufactured tests (which actually are solutions to test against and not class functionality). Also add a few more more manufactured tests....</small>
