<small>Hi @bjornaxis - the fix is much appreciated!  I hope to have time to review soon.  I will have to refresh my memory on code I haven't looked at in a long time.  Meanwhile, would you mind opening an issue on the crashes and provide any info you may have that would help me reproduce it?  If you have any stack traces or other clues that would also be great to have....</small>
