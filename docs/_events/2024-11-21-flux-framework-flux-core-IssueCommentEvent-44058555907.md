<small>You beat me to it! The lua stuff isn't found by default because it's being installed as a variant (the @ syntax) so it isn't linked into the root of homebrew's install.  You can either add the paths to it in the Cellar or run `brew link lua@5.3` to tell it that's the version you want at the top level....</small>
