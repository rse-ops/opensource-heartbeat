<small>There's already a fix for this (I'm fairly sure) but the rest of the flux team doesn't want me to put it in place yet on elcap, because they're working on sorting out some other issues. One thing you can do to avoid it (inconvenient I know sorry) is to force flux to choose specific compute nodes with flux run --requires=hosts:elcap[12-15] or similar....</small>
