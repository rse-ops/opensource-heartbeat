<small>@bernhold I am not sure this is much of a precedent but we did wind up doing something similar with people's names in [this article](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/experiences-replacing-master-slave-terminology-in-ale3d-and-sierra) about `master/slave` in ALE3D and Sierra. But, I was rather haphazard in where those links went...two cases were essentially publication lists of the persons named and the third case was a GitHub profile. The intent there was indeed to give credit or at least point readers in the right direction to *who* those people are. We did have a very short, one sentence acknowledgement where we also used names but, ironically, no links....</small>
