<small>Just a note that GitHub now supports single `$` and GitLab, which formerly use ```$`\pi`$``` now supports the simpler `$\pi$`. Zulip is now the only tool that uses `$$\pi$$` for inline math (it means display math for some), which can be hard to remember when context switching. (I type a lot of math into a lot of different platforms each day.) It'd be lovely if Zulip could bring its dialect into alignment with the many other markdown dialects that support math....</small>
