<small>I'm also experiencing this behavior with v257. I set `HibernateDelaySec=24h` to have my laptop hibernate after being suspended for 24h but this seems to inhibit the laptop from checking the battery and suspending when < 5%. My laptop (Framework 13) has relatively high battery drain meaning I end up regularly finding my laptop with dead (0%) after leaving it for half a day if it wasn't fully charged when I first put it to sleep....</small>
