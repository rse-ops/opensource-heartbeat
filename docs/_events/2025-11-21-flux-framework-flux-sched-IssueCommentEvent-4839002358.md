<small>Based on recent testing on El Cap, it looks like the first three checkboxes will not be enough to enable JGF there. At some point last week, the El Cap system instance was loaded temporarily with JGF, and the whole instance became unresponsive (see e.g. https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/issues/7207). I believe this is still being investigated on the core side....</small>
