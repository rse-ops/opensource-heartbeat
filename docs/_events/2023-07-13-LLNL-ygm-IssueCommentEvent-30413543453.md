<small>Perhaps these concerns just go away if we have different asyncs and collectives for `const` operation, rather than overloading the namespace in an attempt at cleverness as I assumed above. We would make the interface more explicit at the cost of verbosity. We would still need the examples above to fail at compile-time, though....</small>
