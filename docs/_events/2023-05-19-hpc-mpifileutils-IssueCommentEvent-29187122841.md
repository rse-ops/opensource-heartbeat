<small>Yes, good point.  Thanks for the report, @drabmart .  The original intent was not to distribute internal headers, but then we did so since it made it easier for others to develop new tools using the ``libmfu`` library.  I think including ``strmap.h`` was then overlooked.  I'll take a look....</small>
