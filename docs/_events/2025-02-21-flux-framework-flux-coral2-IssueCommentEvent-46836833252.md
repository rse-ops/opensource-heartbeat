<small>Conceptually, it seems cleanest to set the aux flag at the same time the prolog-start event is emitted. Perhaps it would be possible to add an interface to jobtap to allow a plugin to query if there is an outstanding prolog-start or epilog-start event with a given description if that would be easiest in this case....</small>
