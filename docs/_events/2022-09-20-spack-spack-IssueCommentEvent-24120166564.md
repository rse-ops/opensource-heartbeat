<small>> Really find_package should be finding it in either location, if it's not it's probably use of find_library or similar without including the multiarch paths in the list of possibilities. We shouldn't force it to look only in those places, because an admin could have manually built those and put them anywhere, but we could add it to the list or we could specify the path to those dependencies with the _DIR parameters on the command line to work around it....</small>
