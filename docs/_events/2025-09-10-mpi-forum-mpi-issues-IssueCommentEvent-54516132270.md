<small>Fine with me.  In this case I'd like to find an approach which limits API growth.  For the 'c' interfaces could we use a more generic approach for treating the handle - like with ```MPI_T_PVAR_HANDLE_ALLOC```?  Also if there were some way to just say no to f90, then for f08 we could use polymorphism.  I haven't thought much about the copy/delete callbacks though....</small>
