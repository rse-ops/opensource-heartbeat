<small>Definitely anything that can be done to make it easier to preview, save, replay, simulate, etc logs and what the processing will do to them as they go through Logstash would be a huge win. This for us is something that we have started looking at Cribl as a potential solution for. They have a very nice method for doing this capture, and live preview of logs as they are being processed....</small>
