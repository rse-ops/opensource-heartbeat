<small>Not also that this will do the *opposite* of what we were trying to do manually today by eye-balling it. Today, I was trying to transform the low-res data *onto* the high-res data. But, what we really want is the opposite of that...to transform the high-res toe onto the low-res whole foot so that we can effectively fuse them replacing the low-res toe portion with our high res toe....</small>
