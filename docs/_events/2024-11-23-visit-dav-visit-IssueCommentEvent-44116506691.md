<small>Ok, while I believe I did find and fix an issue with the meshname used to cache global node ids, that logic is not in play here. So, this is now *working* because of other changes made since 3.3.3. I confirm bad behavior on `3.3.1` and working behavior on `3.4RC`. Because of this, I believe the issue reported is indeed already fixed by other work...which I've yet to identify where the fix might have happened. I am going to unnassign but close this issue as completed in 3.4.2 as I am getting correct behavior now....</small>
