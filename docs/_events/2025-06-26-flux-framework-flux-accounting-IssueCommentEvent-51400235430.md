<small>Thanks for the review and the helpful feedback @jameshcorbett! I ended up changing this command's name to just `show-usage` - I agree with you that it might be a better name for it than `list-usage`. I also force-pushed up some changes based on your suggestions above. Will set MWP here shortly...</small>
