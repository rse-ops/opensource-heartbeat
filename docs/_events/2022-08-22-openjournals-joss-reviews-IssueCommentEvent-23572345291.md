<small>@sbarbot Also, am I missing some sort of quick-start on how to install and run in the documentation? I think this project needs at least a high-quality README (could be a wiki). Your pipeline yaml kind of has how to install prereqs, build, and run, but it should be somewhere meant to be read by humans. It should be enough for a scientist to follow the steps and interpret results as being physically meaningful in some sense (by visualization or diagnostic output)....</small>
