<small>Thanks for making this issue. The solution isn't quite equivalent. For example, typing `pacman -S xf86-` and triggering `insert-completions` yields `pacman -S xf86-xf86-input-elographics xf86-input-evdev [...]`. I'm newly tinkering with Fish so don't know how to remove the stem before inserting the completions....</small>
