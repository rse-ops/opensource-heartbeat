<small>I'm more just thinking out loud here, but `--requires=hosts:rabbit203` would only work (I think) if constraining the resource graph to only vertexes that match a "hostname" of `rabbit203` would result in something that could match the rest of the job request. (Given that I have no idea how the datawarp/rabbit matches work in Fluxion, I could be way off here)...</small>
