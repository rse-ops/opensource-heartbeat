<small>With MATLAB 2024a or newer, SUNDIALS is packaged with MATLAB so you don't need to install it yourself. Following the examples [here](https://blogs.mathworks.com/matlab/2024/04/17/faster-ordinary-differential-equations-odes-solvers-and-sensitivity-analysis-of-parameters-introducing-sundials-support-in-matlab/), after creating the ode class you can select a SUNDIALS integrator by setting the `Solver` property of the ode class to "cvodesstiff", "cvodesnonstiff" or "idas"....</small>
