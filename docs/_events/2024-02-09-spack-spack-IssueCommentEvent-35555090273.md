<small>Oof... Generally we can get away with it, many systems don't support them or if they do don't support them properly.  I ran into an issue with this using spack in a docker container on mac bind-mounting a MacOS filesystem too.  That's actually the case I'm a bit worried about though, extended attributes can be important in some cases where user namespaces are involved...  Not a super easy call....</small>
