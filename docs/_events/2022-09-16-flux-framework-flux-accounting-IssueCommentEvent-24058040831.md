<small>> FYI [jobtap plugin arguments](https://flux-framework.readthedocs.io/projects/flux-core/en/latest/man7/flux-jobtap-plugins.html#jobtap-plugin-arguments) include the previous job state as prev_state - I don't know if that would be useful here as a simpler way to trigger the lookup of a held job, or if it could just be used as a double-check....</small>
