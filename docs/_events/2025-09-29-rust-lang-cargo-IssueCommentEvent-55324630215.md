<small>This situation occurs a lot with MPI (the communication library) and more generally with C libraries in which build configuration affects the ABI (common in scientific computing libraries, unfortunately). In those cases, the libraries one wants to use are not in a default path and it would have disruptive side-effects to add them (even when using "modules", which are popular on HPC systems)....</small>
