<small>I don't know if this belongs here or elsewhere, but I encountered a similar issue (testing spawn with rsmpi, and then with the MPICH test suite) and tried this branch because latest `main` doesn't build at present (`pmix_server_module_t` compilation error). On this branch, my hang was replaced by an error...</small>
