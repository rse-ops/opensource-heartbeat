<small>Thanks. I'm skeptical even of this result (versus other system noise/thermal throttling or other configuration disparity) because lack of inlining is nanoseconds and you aren't moving through that calling interface millions of times. Also for the other comparisons, I think a more careful profile will show that it's all the same unless your benchmark configuration creates an extra copy or buffer traversal....</small>
