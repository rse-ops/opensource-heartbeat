<small>That begs a question for me.  How often do we run into a DAT where it's composed of multiple banks rather than a single bank for the DAT? I admit I'd conceived of a dat as being a charged entity in and of itself which would be charged for at that level rather than the usage cost falling directly on the users that submitted work to it....</small>
