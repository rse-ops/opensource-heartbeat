<small>This remains obtuse in that it just goes to the generic "contact us" page (presumably this is an email to the technical lead) and the Level 0/1/2 don't define what should be done by the submitter (they can't unilaterally add to these registries) before emailing. A form or GitHub issue template would streamline that....</small>
