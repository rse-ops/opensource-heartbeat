<small>Could we have a `.with_output::<f32>` to return lightweight adaptors that use different precisions? BLIS (which makes no attempt at compile-time type safety) remembers only the representation type of each object (matrix/vector), and allows a non-default "compute precision" associated with the output type. https://github.com/flame/blis/blob/master/docs/MixedDatatypes.md...</small>
