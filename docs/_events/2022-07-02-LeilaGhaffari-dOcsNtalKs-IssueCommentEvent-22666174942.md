<small>Cubic splines have basically the same problem as quadratics. They're losing fidelity at the boundary because their boundary condition doesn't enforce the physics (and thus is dependent on the coarse sampling of points from rather far away). It'll converge under refinement, but we really want nodally exact Lagrange elements here to explain the problem....</small>
