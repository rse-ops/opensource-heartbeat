<small>Honestly I just didn't know that, that makes me think that we might want to expand on that rather than going from that to a big object though.  We've already seen some scaling issues on large json objects in other places, and JGF is likely to get that treatment at some point, so may as well keep it that way here.  Still a good idea to be able to get the events efficiently by type, but keeping it incremental would be good....</small>
