<small>Is your Hessian sparse or dense? If dense, the Hessian can be computed efficiently using the HVP (ideally combined with batching). If sparse and you know the sparsity pattern, you can compute a coloring and efficiently obtain an assembled sparse Hessian using the HVP (some libraries, such as PETSc, will automate this for you). If you want Enzyme to figure out the sparsity pattern and put the matrix in a CSR format, I think that would be a new feature (don't know if Enzyme maintainers would consider it "patches welcome" or out of scope)....</small>
