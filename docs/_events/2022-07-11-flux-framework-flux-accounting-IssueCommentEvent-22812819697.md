<small>> I could see using a field called active being easier to look at and keep track of, so thanks for this suggestion. I'm assuming we could use similar integer values to represent a row if it is "active" or not, 1 for active and 0 for inactive. If this makes more sense and is what you were thinking, I can change the direction of this PR to instead add an active column instead of a deleted column....</small>
