<p>Enhance ELVIRA MIR so it can return clipping plane offsets.</p><small>The ELVIRA MIR algorithm can return a _"normals"_ field on the output Blueprint mesh that contains the orientation of the normals for the clipped fragment. This feature is activated by passing ``options["normal"]=1`` to the algorithm via the options node. This was originally for debugging/visualization. I have a request to be able to return both the normals and the plane offset....</small><a href='https://github.com/LLNL/axom/issues/1565' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
