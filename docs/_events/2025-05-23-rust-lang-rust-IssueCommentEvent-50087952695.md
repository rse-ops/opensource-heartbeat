<small>Thanks. I made the tracking issue #141468 and have updated the documentation to warn against use of `#[target_feature(enable = "ptx80")]`, as well as clarifying how to build. Any further discussion of intrinsics in the documentation can happen after https://github.com/rust-lang/stdarch/pull/1805....</small>
