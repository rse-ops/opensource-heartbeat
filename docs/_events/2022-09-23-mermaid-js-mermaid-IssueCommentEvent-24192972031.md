<small>Hi @sidharthv96 - yes exactly. Since I thought this was just going to be a simple one line change, I chose to make it on the GitHub UI directly. The first failed CI lint run taught me there was a little more to it, but even then I ended up just manually editing the corresponding `docs/` file.. I'm guessing that wasn't the preferred way, however in this case I think the end result is identical (though perhaps I'm wrong)....</small>
