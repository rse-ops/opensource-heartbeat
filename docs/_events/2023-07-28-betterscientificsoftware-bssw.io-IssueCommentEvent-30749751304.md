<small>Just curious but do we speak to this particular issue at all in the draft article we're writing? I know its probably a naggy detail not worth much attention in an article. On the other hand, it is kinda important to get right too and its proven to elude automatic solution for a number of reasons perhaps with sharing in the article....</small>
