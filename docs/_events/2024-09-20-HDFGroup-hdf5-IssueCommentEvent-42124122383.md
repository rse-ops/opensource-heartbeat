<small>Just one other observation to share here and that is that the libver bounds property is associated with file *access*, not file *creation* properties. Therefere, I would NOT expect it to have affected the file creation. Furthermore, the documentation regarding setting of libver bounds (in props or on an open file) does not speak specifically to *file* creation...only *object* creation in a file....</small>
