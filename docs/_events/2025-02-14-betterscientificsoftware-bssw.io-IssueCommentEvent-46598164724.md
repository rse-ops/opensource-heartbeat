<small>@vijaysm and @iulian787 I have started writing and will plod along here periodically. My practice is typically to write often a lot more than necessary and then pare down to get to the final product. So, don't worry too much about length at this point. We can adjust to ensure we emphasize the desired items and don't over saturate with irrelevant details....</small>
