<small>I think that's okay. GitLab-CI supports separate deployed environments within a merge request (they're intended for review), but I don't think GitHub Actions has an equivalent concept yet (it might be possible to add it somewhere within the existing site, or we could make a GitHub repository for reviews). ReadTheDocs does something like that and reports back to the GitHub issue....</small>
