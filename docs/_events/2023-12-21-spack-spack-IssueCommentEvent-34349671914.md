<small>The console is no longer constructed if we don't need it.  Also I added a convenience `-n` to `spack unit-test` that builds the config string for xdist.  It doesn't check if xdist is available, and it assumes that the spack  bin directory is in path, but it works with just `spack unit-test -n 5` or similar....</small>
