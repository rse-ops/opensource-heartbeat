<small>I was thinking of adding mapping functions similar to `xy2d` and `d2xy` from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve (but didn't have time for that yet). Those however seem to work in `O(logN)` where `N` is the width of the domain. Do you have an example for the classic Hilbert curve that works in `O(1)`?...</small>
