<small>> BTW, I think that the intrinsic scope `QV_SCOPE_PROCESS` is quite misleading in my example because OpenMP considers threads and QV treats this silently internally by replacing pids with tids for requests to the server. Should we make this difference explicit? I mean that a thead might want to get the scope for its whole process (not just itself) and right now it's not possible. I think that introducing a `QV_SCOPE_THREAD` could do the trick....</small>
