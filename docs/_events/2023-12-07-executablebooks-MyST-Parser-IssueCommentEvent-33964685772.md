<small>In my use case, I teach using live interactive notebooks with embedded `<video>` elements, so regular Jupyter/RISE needs to understand it. Then I use Jupyter Book to publish the rendered content as a reference for students (with Thebe and Binder in case they want to interact, or they clone the repo locally). `html_image` has been essential to be able to render/position within Jupyter/RISE while getting correct output on the class website. But `<video>` path handling is currently broken and I've been hacking my `_build` outputs with `sed` to repair the paths. I would love to see `html_video` even if only to avoid this manual path hacking....</small>
