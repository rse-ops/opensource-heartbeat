<small>If I write ZFP compressed data with newer Silo/HDF5, the older Silo cannot read it. This is expected because the older Silo library is not set up to use ZFP and there was no generalized approach to specifying an HDF5 filter plugin in older Silo. This is something that should probably be changed....</small>
