<small>I see that in `develop` almost all deprecated versions of `openssl` were removed in #44629. What do we want to do with the versions that are being deprecated by this PR: 3.0.13, 3.1.5, 3.2.1, and 3.3.0? Should we keep them as deprecated or remove them? @haampie, what do you suggest?...</small>
