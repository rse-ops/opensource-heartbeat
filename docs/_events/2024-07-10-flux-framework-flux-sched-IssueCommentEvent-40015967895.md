<small>> Interesting results from undirectedS, not quite what I expected. It came out slightly smaller, another ~100 megabytes taking the total down to 5.2GB RSS, that's more or less expected. The surprise is that the number of allocations and the runtime went back up to be the same as the directedS case. Apparently just getting the up edges out of the out_edges list is enough to get a bit of a win....</small>
