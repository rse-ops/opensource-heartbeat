<p>Support for RTX 3090 by targeting Cuda 11 or newer.</p><small>In my previous ticket #17 I just realized that I can't run this project. I've ran other Cuda 11 projects and just assumed I could downgrade and run old projects, but that doesn't appear to be the case. Seems like all Tensorflow 1.14 projects don't run. This might be asking a lot (not sure the number of changes) but could this project be updated to work with the newest Tensorflow and Cuda or at least Cuda 11 compatible versions....</small><a href='https://github.com/brendenpetersen/deep-symbolic-optimization/issues/18' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
