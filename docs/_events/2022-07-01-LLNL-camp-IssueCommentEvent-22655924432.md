<small>Thanks @rhornung67, I'm glad to hear that's going forward, but thankfully I don't think we're necessarily dependent on that rework to fix this.  I can put in the stopgap in camp for now at least, and we may be able to do something in BLT to either select the static runtime or allow the runtime interface deps to not propagate....</small>
