<small>This error should only come up when compiling an application without OpenMP against a RAJA that was built with OpenMP.  I also notice the camp in that spec does not list a +openmp variant, which tells me you aren't using the version of the camp package from spack's develop branch, so camp isn't getting the correct flags to add the OpenMP target correctly to the output....</small>
