<small>We could make a `flux queue list` using similar interfaces built on `flux.util.OutputFormat` like `flux jobs` and `flux resource list`. This would present a consistent and familiar API for users. We'd need to make a `Queue` class and have name/limits/defaults/etc available as attributes of each queue object. We might want to wait to implement this until we're certain we don't have to redo anything about the current queues implementation....</small>
