<small>I'm fine with this change, but I left out the COC b/c it's a requirement for all Linux Foundation projects, which I thought @jlapolla-cray wanted (per #33).  It's something to check before voting, but if they make it into LF they'll have a COC so it *kind of* doesn't matter to me whether it's in the vote....</small>
