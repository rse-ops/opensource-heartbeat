<small>@JacobLotz sorry for the inconvenience, but I am glad to hear you got it to build. On my MacBook, `./scripts/compile.sh` works automatically, so maybe there is an issue on Ubuntu. Perhaps `README.md` should mention `./scripts/setup.sh`. Our build system expert is @pranav-vempati, so maybe he can make some improvements for Ubuntu. By the way, please note that `./scripts/compile.sh -m` builds with MFEM....</small>
