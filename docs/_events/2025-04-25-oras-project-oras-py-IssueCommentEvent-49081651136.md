<small>Another related issue (that it would be great if you want to add here) is that if headers is None, it can be passed [here](https://github.com/oras-project/oras-py/blob/b130349539d3efe846d18187e19eb31b19f6454b/oras/auth/token.py#L89) and we attempt to set an attribute on None. There probably should be a `headers = headers or {}` somewhere in there. What do you think?...</small>
