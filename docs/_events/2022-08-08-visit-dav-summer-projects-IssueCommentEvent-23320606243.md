<small>@wmondy one thing I would like to do soon is find a good color map that allows us to match these views with some of your SEM views. The red just doesn't work for that. Also, I think it might be worthwhile to try to *duplicate* some of the SEM images with volume rendering. We should talk about what is required to do that (in addition to color map). I think we need some idea of the electron beam attenuation properties into the material so that we can define equiv. *transfer* functions for volume rendering. Getting the same view angles would be great too....</small>
