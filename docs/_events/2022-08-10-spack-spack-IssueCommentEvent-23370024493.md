<small>FWIW, #31739 finally built after I added a version bump for sqlite to prod the downstream hashes.  I can't get into the build on the build the world PR #31752 to see what was failing there with gitlab down but if that's something innocuous we may be able to take that, or you could pull the sqlite bump over here....</small>
