<p>qv_scope_create() is broken with QV_SCOPE_FLAG_NO_SMT</p><small>I'm looking into a solution. I've found the problem, but a potential solution may involve maintaining multiple topologies. That is, if we detect the use of QV_SCOPE_FLAG_NO_SMT, we can restrict the topology, but then we can't use that one for other scopes without the SMT flag....</small><a href='https://github.com/hpc/quo-vadis/issues/411' target='_blank'>View Comment</a>
