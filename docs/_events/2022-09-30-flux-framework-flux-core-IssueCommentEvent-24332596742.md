<small>Thanks for tagging me in this @jameshcorbett. I think out of the two Python formatters, I prefer `black`. I agree with James that pylint can sometimes be a pain, but it is useful to have while writing Python code. I often catch myself making dumb mistakes that get revealed when I run pylint, so to me, I like having both. I don't have a lot of experience contributing to Python projects outside of Flux, so having these two formatters run at the same time on my code is just something I learned to adapt and accept, and never really gave it any thought (but maybe it comes with my own naivety). :P ...</small>
