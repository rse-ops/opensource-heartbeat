<small>That's a different sort of test harness. It would be a good project to create it, but it's going to be more intrusive than something we already know how to measure. Also, constants matter, so having a test that enforces "no algorithm in PETSc should exhibit $\omega(n \log^k n)$ complexity" ($\omega$ notation is an open lower bound) isn't assurance that code is efficient. This issue is about something practical for performance, not that other thing (which would be useful, but not a replacement for this)....</small>
