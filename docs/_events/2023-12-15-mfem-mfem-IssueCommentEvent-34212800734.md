<small>@sebastiangrimberg it would nice to have a unit test if it doesn't take too much work, but I agree that it is not absolutely necessary. There are lots of good tests in https://github.com/mfem/mfem/pull/3746 and I was hoping a simple test like those could be made, for example with 2 tets on 2 MPI ranks, sharing an equilateral triangle. Maybe it is tricky to construct a small example with inconsistent ordering in the current master branch....</small>
