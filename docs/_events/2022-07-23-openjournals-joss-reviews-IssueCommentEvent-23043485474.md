<small>I think the question is what is useful/expected by the target audience. If they'll be happy with inline help via docstrings rendered in their IDE, then that's enough. If you'll miss a sizable fraction of the audience by not having a sphinx site that users can browse and link to, then you can recommend creating one....</small>
