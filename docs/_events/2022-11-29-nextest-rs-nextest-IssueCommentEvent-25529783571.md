<small>Thanks! I started out by writing a custom harness that builds and runs examples, but found it's nicer to use `cargo nextest run --example abc` (see #681) in part because things like features automatically match between the `cargo test`/`cargo nextest run` invocation and the way the binary is built, and also because I don't have to deal with parallel `cargo build` instances fighting for their locks....</small>
