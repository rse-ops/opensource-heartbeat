<small>The test continued to pass because the `grep` check was lazy (and my fault); `grep -w "username: user5015\|bank: F\|default_bank: F" new_default_bank.out` was checking for a whole-word match for one of the patterns instead of all three. I changed this `grep` check to be more strict and check that all three were present....</small>
