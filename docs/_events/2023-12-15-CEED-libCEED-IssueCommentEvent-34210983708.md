<small>I stalled out and focused on some Ratel work before wrapping up the final stage of this issue. @jedbrown I think this last stage of the GPU `/gen` backend refactor would let us most easily incorporate the new basis (including particles) work into these backends. Depending upon prioritization, I think this would be a good think to try to make time for in the spring....</small>
