<small>Probably the most common is Q=14 followed by Q=24, which are minimal symmetric quadratures for second and third order tets. For CFD, we'll have cubic prisms, which have Q=48 because libCEED doesn't support tensorization of a triangle with a line. Note that cubic hexes need Q=64, but those should be computed using a `*/gen` backend when doing mixed topology....</small>
