<small>@ZuseZ4 You should be able to pull this and just run `cargo test` (or `cargo +enzyme test` if you haven't set an override). See the README for more details. As discussed in Zulip, I propose dropping `mdbook test`. I'm using `#[cfg(broken)]` to disable blocks that currently cause compilation errors, though there are better ways we could handle that....</small>
