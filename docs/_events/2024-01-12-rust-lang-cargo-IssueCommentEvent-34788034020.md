<small>Hi, I'm curious if this is being abandoned or needs some specific help. My use case is building crates with `--target nvptx64-nvidia-cuda` and also as a regular lib dependency on the host. I'm currently doing this with a `build.rs`, but this RFC would offer a much better user experience....</small>
