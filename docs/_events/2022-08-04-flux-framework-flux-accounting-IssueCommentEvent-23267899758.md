<small>Yeah, I'm not entirely sure of a best approach either. I was a little hesitant to include an `update-db` command to be run on a periodic basis because the DB really only needs updating when a new version of flux-accounting is installed that contains a schema change. That was just my assumption though of how the existing flux-accounting cron jobs are run, so like you mentioned, maybe more time needs to be spent thinking of a good solution. I think I should open a separate issue to track this....</small>
