<small>This one I've only ever seen on Windows, which I don't have on a dev machine. I actually don't know if it's a code problem or environment problem. I've seen Windows runners sometimes be flaky at earlier stages like git clone and I have much less confidence in correctness of MS-MPI than in MPICH or Open MPI....</small>
