<small>For the records, my impression so far is that there is a bug in Spack with the detection of the compiler @long58 added. Clang@19.0.0 does not seem to be an official release. Testing suggests that naming the compiler `clang@19.0.0` would be fine (spack would extrapolate) but `clang@19.0.0.something` is too much....</small>
