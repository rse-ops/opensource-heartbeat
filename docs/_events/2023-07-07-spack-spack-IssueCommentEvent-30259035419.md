<small>You're seeing this issue: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14373, which we first encountered with `numpy` in #38704.  It's not that we scan everything in the Spack tree (far from it).  It's that you have `IPython` installed and `mypy` will check *every* reachable import from your package.  `spack python` can optionally run `IPython`....</small>
