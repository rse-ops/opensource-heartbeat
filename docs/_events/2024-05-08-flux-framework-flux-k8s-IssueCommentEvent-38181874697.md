<small>I'm in the process of reviewing this PR, but it is taking quite a while. There's a lot of churn in the commits, e.g., `fluence.go` is updated 17 times across commits. That makes it difficult to track the desired final state and also causes me to wonder if my comments will be obviated by a later commit....</small>
