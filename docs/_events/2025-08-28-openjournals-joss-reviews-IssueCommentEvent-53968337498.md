<small>Yeah, the options are extensible, akin to a programming language, and `-help` is used to show everything that can be specified in the current expansion. You can't get to the entire expansion without running. It would be possible (at substantial cross-cutting effort and maintainability impact) to make a system that shows the useful options in a simulation, but even that would be unable to deal with solution-dependent logic (e.g., solve an auxiliary problem, enter an optimization loop, and/or write output only if the solution satisfies a numeric criteria). The decision to make `-help` comprehensive and extensible was made (by the PETSc team) long ago and responsive to community needs. We could bikeshed over a different name, but this is widely used and accepted in the PETSc community and we consider it a feature that Ratel be readily usable by people familiar with configuring PETSc solvers via run-time options (which you can liken to a domain-specific programming language)....</small>
