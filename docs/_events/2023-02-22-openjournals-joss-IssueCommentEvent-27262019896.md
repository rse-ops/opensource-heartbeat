<small>My original text included a non-exclusive list of potential reasons, but @danielskatz [preferred](https://github.com/openjournals/joss/pull/805#discussion_r496314414) to simplify. We don't ask for a justification so an author does not need to explain why they're making the request. I'm not sure which is better....</small>
