<small>This isn't a review comment on this PR but I noticed libb64 pop up and wondered if you knew about the embeddable base64 implementation in [ccan](https://github.com/rustyrussell/ccan/blob/master/ccan/base64/base64.h)?  We've pulled that in to flux-core along with other useful ccan modules e.g. see [here](https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-core/tree/master/src/common/libccan/ccan).  Just thinking maybe dyad would benefit if users don't have to install/configure an external package for base64....</small>
