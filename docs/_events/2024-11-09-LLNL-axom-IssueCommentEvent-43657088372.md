<small>I added a script that will make BASH scripts to run the _mir_concentric_circles_ example program on various platforms and gather the caliper data results. I plotted the MIR runtime and some things look good, some very bad at the moment. I think SEQ mode could be optimized more to bring it down, likely bringing down time in the other modes too. OMP has inexplicably bad performance. I've seen some hints of this before during development but focused more on GPU so far. I'll need to profile OMP and see what's the matter....</small>
