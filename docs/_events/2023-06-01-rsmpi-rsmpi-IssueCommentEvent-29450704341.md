<small>I don't personally use Windows and don't have experience debugging this particular issue via email. I wonder if anyone else in the community can reproduce or if you can replicate in an environment that's possible to use in CI. (I don't really understand how it's 2023 and Windows is still so lousy at virtualizing.) Sorry I can't be of more help at the moment....</small>
