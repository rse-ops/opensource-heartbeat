<small>@rhornung67 I was thinking that the other projects copy the `subscribed-pipelines.yml` into their own repository (rather than include it from here).  So other projects could decide to comment out/delete the Dane pipeline if they don't want it. This seems to be what RAJA is doing (see https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA/blob/develop/.gitlab/subscribed-pipelines.yml).  It would be good to know though if other projects are in fact including the file rather than using it as a template and making their own copy of it.  Regardless, its great to test on more machines I suppose too!  Happy to contribute. ...</small>
