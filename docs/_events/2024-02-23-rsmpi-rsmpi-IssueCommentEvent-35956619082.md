<small>A PR to improve docs would absolutely be welcome! Note that we now use `-Zrustdoc-scrape-examples` (#173; but haven't published a new version since adding that). With nightly, you can `cargo doc` to see those snippets. That might have helped you, or offer a way in which to document things....</small>
