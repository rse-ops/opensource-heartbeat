<small>> It makes me lean to the idea of having a "mixed" db as I call it above. The eventlog is stored as it is above, with possibly some special handling of exceptions (maybe other events too). We have DB columns for important fields. Longer out, we can add sqlite plugin extensions for faster / simpler hostlist / rank searches in sqlite for those columns....</small>
