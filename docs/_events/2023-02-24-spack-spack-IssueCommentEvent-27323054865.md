<small>One more comment, in another instance (an ubuntu container) -- I was blocked b/c I was missing `file` when I created a new container.  It was default installed in some of my prior docker builds but I need to explicitly install it in the new version of the OS.  It took me quite a while to get to the bottom of the error. ...</small>
