<small>How many of these boundary edges do you need? Would it be possible to label them (e.g., with "Face Sets" or another label)? One of the reasons is that if you just use global edge numbers, you need extra code to interpret a grid refinement study. I'd rather talk about physical surfaces that can be one or more edge, and the simulation code sums over those edges to create the CSV output....</small>
