<small>Test is done, and I cleaned up the Go testing file (and added that final test). [Link to PR for future reference](https://github.com/flux-framework/fluxion-go/pull/12/files). The bug was that I needed to include the full path of the cluster -> rack in the graph to add (which I'm fairly sure you told me) and then one of my identifiers was wrong - a "file already exists" error. Fixing those two things resulted in a working grow API! :hamburger: ...</small>
