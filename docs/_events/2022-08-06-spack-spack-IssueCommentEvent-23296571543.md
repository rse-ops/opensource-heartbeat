<small>Ok, looks like maybe some friction here. @haampie I pinged you because I remembered you working on the view copy code, would you mind pointing out where that class and stuff ended up?  If we can re-use that I imagine it would take care of this, since I remember you dealing with almost exactly this problem before. As far as I can tell though, you're saying we should be checking islink rather than isdir and linking rather than copying through, is that what you meant? If so the change might be almost identical just special casing links rather than directories right?...</small>
